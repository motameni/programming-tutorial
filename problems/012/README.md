Question 12:

Write a Python program that generates a list of numbers from a specified "from" number (inclusive) to a specified "to" number (exclusive). You should create a list that includes the "from" number and goes up to, but does not include, the "to" number. Your program should then print the generated list.

Example:

Suppose you are given the following values at the beginning of your program:

```python
from_number = 3
to_number = 8
```

Your program should generate the list of numbers from 3 to 7 (inclusive of 3 and exclusive of 8) and print the list:

```
Generated list: [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

Your task:

Set the values of from_number and to_number at the beginning of your program.
Write code to generate the list of numbers as specified.
Print the generated list.
