Problem 4:

You are working on a simplified simulation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors." Given the choices of two players, player1_choice and player2_choice, your task is to write Python code that determines the winner of the game round and prints out the result. The rules of the game are as follows:

Rock beats Scissors.
Scissors beat Paper.
Paper beats Rock.
If both players choose the same option, it's a tie.

You're provided with the following code structure:

```python
player1_choice = "rock"  # This is just an example. The player's choice can vary.
player2_choice = "scissors"  # This is just an example. The player's choice can vary.

# Your code here to determine the winner and print the result
```

Fill in the code to determine and print the winner of the round based on the given choices. Ensure your solution handles all potential game outcomes, and properly address the scenario where an invalid choice might be made.
