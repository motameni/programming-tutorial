Problem 3:

Complete the Python code below to determine the category of a given age according to the following rules:

If the age is less than 13, assign the category "Child" to the variable category.
If the age is between 13 (inclusive) and 19 (inclusive), assign the category "Teenager" to the variable category.
If the age is 20 or older, assign the category "Adult" to the variable category.

```python
age = 25
category = None

# Your code goes here

print("The category is:", category)
```

Fill in the code between the comments to determine the correct category based on the given age, and then print the category.

Make sure to use the if, elif, and else statements to accomplish this task.
