Problem 19: Palindrome Checker

Write a program that takes a word or phrase as input and checks whether it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). The program should print "Palindrome" if the input is a palindrome and "Not a palindrome" otherwise.

Example input and output:
```
Input: "A man a plan a canal Panama"
Output: "Palindrome"

Input: "Python is fun"
Output: "Not a palindrome"
```
