Problem 5: Python Temperature Classifier

Given a predefined variable temperature, classify the temperature into the following categories using nested if-else statements:

Freezing:
If the temperature is of type float or int.
If the temperature is less than or equal to 0°C.

Cold:
If the temperature is of type float or int.
If the temperature is greater than 0°C and less than or equal to 12°C.

Moderate:
If the temperature is of type float or int.
If the temperature is greater than 12°C and less than or equal to 24°C.

Warm:
If the temperature is of type float or int.
If the temperature is greater than 24°C.

Invalid:
If the temperature is not of type float or int.

Your code should print the appropriate classification as a string.
