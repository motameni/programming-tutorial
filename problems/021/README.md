Problem 21: Multiplication Table Generator

Write a Python function called generate_multiplication_table that takes an integer n as input and prints the multiplication table for the numbers 1 through 10 for that value of n.

Your program should prompt the user to enter a number, call the generate_multiplication_table function, and display the resulting multiplication table.

Sample Input:
```
Enter a number: 7
```

Sample Output:

```
7 x 1 = 7
7 x 2 = 14
7 x 3 = 21
7 x 4 = 28
7 x 5 = 35
7 x 6 = 42
7 x 7 = 49
7 x 8 = 56
7 x 9 = 63
7 x 10 = 70
```
