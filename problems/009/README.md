Problem 9:

Find the sum of all the even numbers in a given list.

Sample list:

```python
numbers = [1, 4, 7, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40]
```

Your task is to use for loops to iterate through the numbers list and calculate the sum of all even numbers in the list. You should not use a separate function for this task, but instead, use for loops to iterate through the list and keep a running sum of the even numbers you encounter. Finally, print the sum.
