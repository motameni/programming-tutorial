Problem 15:

Write a Python program that takes an integer input, representing the count of names. The program should then prompt the user to enter each name and store them in a list. Finally, it should print the list of names.

```
Enter the count of names: 3
Enter name #1: Alice
Enter name #2: Bob
Enter name #3: Charlie

List of names:
['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
```

Write a Python script that implements the above behavior. Ensure that your program handles different cases, such as when the count is zero.
