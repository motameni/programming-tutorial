Problem 14: Ticket Pricing

You are tasked with creating a program to determine the price of a movie ticket based on the following rules:

The base price of a standard adult ticket is $10.
If the ticket is for a child (age 12 or younger), there is a $2 discount on the base price.
If the ticket is for a senior citizen (age 65 or older), there is a $3 discount on the base price.
If the ticket is for a student (age 13-18), there is a $1 discount on the base price.
Matinee shows (before 5:00 PM) have a $1 discount on the base price.
Write a Python program that takes two inputs: the age of the moviegoer (an integer) and whether it's a matinee show (a boolean, True or False). Based on these inputs, calculate the final price of the movie ticket using nested if statements.

```python
# Inputs
age = 16        # Age of the moviegoer
matinee = False # True if it's a matinee show, False otherwise

# Base price of a standard adult ticket
base_price = 10

# Write your code here to calculate the final price based on the provided inputs.
# Use nested if statements to apply the discounts.

# Output the final price of the ticket.
```

Your task is to complete the code snippet by using nested if statements to calculate the final price of the movie ticket based on the provided inputs. Consider all the rules mentioned in the problem statement and apply discounts accordingly.

After calculating the final price, print it to the console.
