Problem 1:

You are given the following variables:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
height = 5.8
is_student = False
```
Write Python code to do the following:

Calculate the year of birth (birth_year) based on the current year (considering the current year as 2023) and the age.
Create a new variable is_teenager and assign it a Boolean value True if the age is between 13 and 19 (inclusive), or False otherwise.
Determine the data type of each variable (name, age, height, is_student) and store them in separate variables (name_type, age_type, height_type, is_student_type).
This question assesses your knowledge of variables, data types, and basic calculations in Python.
