Problem 7:

You are given a list of numbers. Write a Python program to calculate the sum of all the numbers in the list that are greater than or equal to 5. You should use only a for loop to iterate through the list.

```python
# Given mylist of numbers
numbers = [2, 7, 4, 1, 9, 6, 3, 8]

# Initialize a variable to store the total
total = 0

# Write a for loop to calculate the total of numbers greater than or equal to 5
# Your code here

# Print the total of numbers greater than or equal to 5
print("Sum of numbers greater than or equal to 5:", total)

```
