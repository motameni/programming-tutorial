Problem 13: The Grading System

In a school, the grading system is based on the following rules:

If a student's score is 90 or more, they receive an 'A' grade.
If a student's score is between 80 and 89 (inclusive), they receive a 'B' grade.
If a student's score is between 70 and 79 (inclusive), they receive a 'C' grade.
If a student's score is between 60 and 69 (inclusive), they receive a 'D' grade.
If a student's score is below 60, they receive an 'F' grade.
Write a Python program that takes a student's score as an integer and determines the corresponding grade according to the rules above. You do not need to take input from the user; you should use the variable provided below.

```python
# Given student score
score = 78  # You should use this variable to determine the grade.

# Write your code here to calculate the grade based on the provided score.

# Use if statements to determine the grade and store it in the variable 'grade'.

# Output the grade to the console.
```

Your task is to complete the code snippet by using if statements to determine the grade based on the provided score and store it in the 'grade' variable. Then, print the grade to the console.
