Problem 2:

You are given the following code snippet:
```python
a = 5
b = 5.0

if ___CONDITION___:
    result = "Same type"
else:
    result = "Different types"
```
Fill in the ```___CONDITION___``` such that the value of the variable result becomes "Same type" if the variables a and b are of the same data type and "Different types" if they are not.

What would be the value of the result variable after executing the code?
